# US Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE)

This R code produces charts used in the [Stubborn Mule](http://www.stubbornmule.net) blog post [Has the US consumer shaken off the financial crisis?](http://www.stubbornmule.net/2010/04/us-consumption-growth/)

The [original data](http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/pi/pinewsrelease.htm) is published by the [US Bureau of Economic Analysis](http://www.bea.gov). This data is also collated by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in their ["FRED" Economic Database](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/). The R code here makes use of the quantmod module to source the data from FRED.
