First attempt at setting up a git repository.

The plan is to store code used for analysis and charts on the blog
"A Stubborn Mule's Perspective": http://www.stubbornmule.net/

The first project I have added is the code to produce charts based on the
Guardian's "1000 Songs to Hear Before You Die". Some of these charts appear
in this blog post: http://www.stubbornmule.net/2009/07/love-old-fashioned/
