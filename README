First attempt at setting up a git repository.

The plan is to store code used for analysis and charts on the blog
"A Stubborn Mule's Perspective": http://www.stubbornmule.net/

The first project I have added is the code to produce charts based on the
Guardian's "1000 Songs to Hear Before You Die". Some of these charts appear
in this blog post: http://www.stubbornmule.net/2009/07/love-old-fashioned/

Files ending in .R contain code written for R, an open source statistical
package. For more information about R, visit the website:
http://www.r-project.org/
The package is available for download for Windows, Mac and Linux here:
