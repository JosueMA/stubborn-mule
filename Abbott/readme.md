Abbott - speech analysis
------------------------

* `abbott.py` -- python script to download speeches
* `abbott.R` -- R script to generate word cloud and history chart

In the interests of space, the speech data is not included here: if you want to try out the scripts, you will have to create a subdirectory called `abbott` and run the python script.

The coding is rough around the edges: suggestions for improvements are welcome!
